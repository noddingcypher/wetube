Node Package Manager (NPM)

- place where somethings like express shared
- in conventional method, when a guy wants to update the things,
  he needs to download and install periodically - sucking thing
- NPM is centralized place where all the packages come in (eps. nodeJS things)
- updating, installing is done easily by NPM (thru dependency on NPM)
- sexy way to install express

express is framework of nodeJS

- making a server with several lines of code
- including lots of code in advance

Express of nodeJS

- Django of python, Laravel of php

Operating a server is quite the same, repetitive

- few things left to be updated
